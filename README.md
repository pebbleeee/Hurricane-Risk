Hi, This is a project done with a group of my friends to assign risk scores for hurricanes via sea surface temperature on years of hurricanes and El Nino. Report Included!
The ENSO.csv and the hurdat2...txt files were input data we used in the analysis
HurricaneRiskAnalysis.ipynb is the jupyter notebook with all the code and it has been ran.
HurricaneRiskAnalysisReport.docx.pdf is the report which includes the explanation of the project.
